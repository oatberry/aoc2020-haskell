* Advent of Code 2020 Ã  la Haskell
I threw together a quick haskell project that I'll use for AoC 2021, just day 1 is present here for reference. Maybe I'll fill out the rest someday :)
** What's this all about then?
Each day gets its own module, and they get imported into ~Main~ and put into a list, it's pretty sweet.
There are some utility functions in ~Common~ for some nice things like running the parts of the day with output, fetching a day's input from adventofcode.com directly and caching it, and a couple other things.
